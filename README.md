# Investigate_a_Dataset_Guns_USA
The datasets used for this investigation are census and FBI's National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) curated data. Gun dealers could do a background check to confirm the eligibility of a buyer to acquire guns or explosives. The NICS provides information on the checks performed across different states in the USA. This data is not suitable to measure gun sales. The census data, on the other hand, provides more information on a state-by-state basis. It is worthy of note that the census dataset is messy and dirty; hence, requiring intense data cleaning.
